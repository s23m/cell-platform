A convention that should be followed in exception messages is * to include in the message "key keyValue" e.g. "key 1234" so that keys can be parsed out of exception messages. * <p/> * Updated in version 1.5 to remove <code>getInitialCause</code> which was a left over from the pre-JDK1.4 * days. It breaks JAXB. * * @author Greg Luck * @version $Id: CacheException.java 2154 2010-04-06 02:45:52Z cdennis $ * */public class CacheException extends RuntimeException {	/**	 * Constructor for the CacheException object.	 */	public CacheException() {		super();	}	/**	 * Constructor for the CacheException object.	 * @param message the exception detail message	 */	public CacheException(final String message) {		super(message);	}	/**	 * Constructs a new CacheException with the specified detail message and	 * cause.  <p>Note that the detail message associated with	 * <code>cause</code> is <i>not</i> automatically incorporated in	 * this runtime exception's detail message.	 *	 * @param  message the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval	 *         by the {@link #getMessage()} method).	 * @param  cause the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the	 *         {@link #getCause()} method).
